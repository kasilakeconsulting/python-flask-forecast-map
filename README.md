# python-flask-forecast-map
A Python/Flask API is used to fetch forecast information for the point clicked on a map.

clickforecast.html uses Javascript to display a dynamic map of the U.S. (via LeafJS and MapBox) and after a click on the map it uses a Python/Flask API we wrote to get a week's weather forecast from the National Weather Service.

See https://kasilakeconsulting.com/clickforecast.html for source references.

The NWS API information is located at: https://weather-gov.github.io/api/general-faqs
